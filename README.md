# vste

_vste_ stands for very simple text editor. It is inspired by old time editor classics from the pre-vim time such as _ed_.

The goal was to create a working and functional text editor which does not rely on a GUI or even CLI graphics.
_vste_ will become part of a family of minimalistic utility programs in the style of _suckless_ software.
Trademarks will be:

1. Strong performance
2. Minimal lines of code
3. Implementation of the _"worse is better"_ philosophy
4. Low disk usage
